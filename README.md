# Task 1. Software Configuration
## Subtask 1. Why did I choose to participate in the portfolio challenge?
Hey! Nice to e-meet you :blush: 

I'm Halyna. A couple of weeks ago I came across an Insta ad saying "free QA Automated Testing course". So I thought: “Why not give it try?”. This happened literally 3 hours after I decided I needed to find a new direction, so it was probably **a sign**.

What I came to understand after working for an IT company is:

- I’ve always been intrigued by how computers work and the amazing things you can make them do;
- I don’t want to be stuck in Customer Support, I want to move forward in life and give ‘real’ IT a go. 

So that’s why I’m writing this message now. I really hope I’ll manage to complete this course and get plenty of new knowledge and a certificate.


Many thanks!
